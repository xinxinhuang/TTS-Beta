Standing Tee Time Analysis:
1. Eligibility & Group Size: Only Shareholder members are eligible to request a standing tee time, and it must be for a foursome.  
2. Request Method: Eligible members submit a "Standing Tee Time Request" card. This card details the names and member numbers of all four players (listing the Shareholder member first), the requested day, tee time (+/- 30 minutes), and the desired start and end dates for the recurring booking.  
3. Conflict Resolution: If multiple requests overlap, the club's rules committee assigns a priority number to each request card to resolve conflicts.  
4. Scheduling Procedure:
   * Tee sheets are prepared one week in advance.  
   * A clerk first blocks out times unavailable due to special events or tournaments.  
   * The clerk then schedules the approved standing tee times onto the sheet according to their assigned priority.  
   * After standing tee times are placed, remaining slots are filled with phone/in-person bookings on a first-come, first-served basis.  
5. Day-of-Play Management: On the actual golf day, the completed tee sheet is managed by the pro shop staff, who handle check-ins and any necessary modifications. They also accommodate same-day requests if possible.  
This process gives Shareholder members a way to secure a regular weekly tee time for their group, although it's subject to availability and potential conflicts resolved by a priority system. how do we implement it on top of our current system

Analyzing Your Current Project Structure

Database Schema Check

Look at your database migration files or EF Core model for the StandingTeeTimeRequest table
Check if it contains all the necessary fields or needs the suggested modifications


Code Structure Evaluation

Check your existing services and repositories to see which components can be extended



Component-by-Component Comparison
1. Data Model
Check if your StandingTeeTimeRequest entity already has:
Copy- int RequestID
- int MemberID
- DayOfWeek Day
- TimeSpan PreferredTime
- string Status
- DateTime RequestDate
Additions needed:
Copy- int Player2ID
- int Player3ID
- int Player4ID
- DateTime StartDate
- DateTime EndDate
- int PriorityNumber
2. Services Layer
Look for existing services that handle:

Member operations
Tee time scheduling
Admin operations

Extensions needed:

Add validation for Shareholder membership in the Member service
Add methods to assign priorities to standing requests
Extend tee sheet generation to handle standing tee times

3. Repository Layer
Check if you have repositories for:

StandingTeeTimeRequest
Reservations
TeeSheet
TeeTime

Ensure they have CRUD operations that can support the new functionality.
4. Controller/API Layer
Look for existing controllers that handle:

Member operations
Admin operations
Tee time booking

Additions needed:

Endpoint for creating standing tee time requests
Endpoint for retrieving all standing requests
Endpoint for assigning priorities

5. UI Components
Check for existing UI components that handle:

Member forms
Admin dashboards
Tee time booking interfaces

Additions needed:

Form for submitting standing tee time requests
Admin UI for reviewing and prioritizing requests

Implementation Approach

Start with minimal changes

First, update your data model
Then add the necessary service methods
Finally, implement the UI components


Use existing patterns

Follow the same architecture and patterns you're already using
Keep consistent with your current implementation style
Reuse existing components where possible


Test incrementally

Test each component as you implement it
Particularly test the tee sheet generation logic with standing times



Specific Recommendations Based on Common Project Structures
If your project uses:

Layered Architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)

Add the new methods to your existing service classes
Extend your controllers with the new endpoints


Clean Architecture

Add the new use cases for standing tee time operations
Update your entities and implement the corresponding interfaces


CQRS Pattern

Create new commands and queries for standing tee time operations
Implement the handlers for these commands and queries
